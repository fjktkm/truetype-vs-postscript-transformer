If you set up the environment manually, refer to the `postCreateCommand` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for installation instructions.

### 5. Download the dataset

You can download the dataset using the following command:

```bash
uv run truetype_vs_postscript_transformer/scripts/download.py
```

Since the dataset exceeds 1 GB, the download may take some time.

### 6. Train and Evaluate the Model
